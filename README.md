# Marketplace (in development)

## Abstract

This repository contains the source code for the Marketplace application, a platform that enables users to list their own items for sale and purchase items from others, similar in concept to Facebook Marketplace. The application is built using an event-sourcing architecture.

## Technlogies

- Typescript - programming language
- ExpressJS - API application framework
- React - UI Framework
- Bootstrap - CSS framework
- Auth0 - authentication
- AWS S3 Bucket - storage
- Postgres - database
- Docker Compose - runtime

## Description

This document is divided into several sections. The current section provides an overview of the project, including the services developed to support the application and the technologies used. Following this, you will find a Tutorial explaining how to use the application. Below the tutorial, the Requirements section outlines the necessary tools, and finally, the Installation section guides you through the setup process.

### Services overview

User interaction is handled through a website developed using React, with React Bootstrap serving as the dedicated CSS framework for styling. The data displayed on the website is retrieved from an API service built with Node.js and Express.js. For persistence, the application uses a PostgreSQL database, while an S3 bucket is employed for storing images. The diagram below illustrates the services that were implemented to build this application.

### Event Sourcing architecture

The application is built using an Event Sourcing architecture pattern. Users can purchase items listed in the Marketplace, as well as create, update, archive, restore, and delete their own listings. Each of these actions generates an event that is stored in the event store table.

Process managers operate as separate applications responsible for handling these events and updating the states table based on the event type. This approach provides a complete history of user activity and listing changes.

The diagram below illustrates the database tables created for this application.

## Tutorial

How to use this application? It is very simple. Main page looks like:

### Login

You can browse and view listings without logging in. However, logging in allows you to purchase items and create your own listings. Click the Login button, and you will be redirected to the Auth0 page, where you will need to create an account. After successful authentication, you will be redirected back to the Marketplace, where you should see a dashboard similar to the example below.

Notice that the Login to add listing button has been replaced by the _+ Create Listing_ button, and next to it, you will find a _Filter By_ dropdown. On the far right of the navigation bar, the Login button is replaced by your account nickname and profile photo.

### View and buy listing

On the main page, each listing shows only one photo along with the itemâ€™s name and price. To view more details, you can click the View button, which will open the full listing and display the description. If the listing contains multiple photos, a carousel will automatically rotate through them every few seconds.

When you want to purchase an item, simply press the Buy button and it will be added to your purchases. You can review all the items you have bought by setting the Filter By option to Your Purchases.

### Add your listing

You can add a new item by pressing the + Create Listing button. To complete the process, you must upload at least one photo, set a price, and provide both a title and a description for the listing. For form validation project uses [Formik](https://formik.org/) module. Once your listing is added, it will appear on the main page alongside other listings. However, instead of displaying a View button like the others, your listings will feature a Modify button, allowing you to edit them at any time.

### Modify your listings

To view listings available for purchase, set the Filter By option to Your Active. You can modify the details of an existing listing by selecting Edit from the Listing Modify dropdown menu.

You can also Archive a listing, which makes it invisible to all users except you. This allows you the option to restore the listing at a later time. Alternatively, you may choose to Delete a listing permanently.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Auth0 account
- AWS account

## Installation process

You need to do steps below to install this project.

### Install Docker

To install this project you have to need a have a Docker on your local machine and be able to perform _docker compose_ actions.

### Download project

If you have installed Github you can download a project from Github by executing command below. Otherwise, download and unpack a zip file from here [here](https://github.com/Bartosz95/marketplace/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

```
git clone https://github.com/Bartosz95/marketplace.git
```

### Authentication account

In your Auth0 account, create two applications.
First, create a _Regular Web Application_. Fill in the required fields, and in the _Application URIs_ section, set http://localhost for:

- Allowed Callback URLs
- Allowed Logout URLs
- Allowed Web Origins

Next, create a second application of type _API_. Once created, navigate to the _Machine to Machine Applications_ tab and enable authorization for the previously created Regular Web Application.

### Configure environment variables

Configure 2 _.env_ files.

In `<project_dir>/api/` directory create a `.env` file with _AUTH_AUDIENCE_ and _AUTH_ISSUER_BASE_URL_ taken from Auth0 webside.

```
AUTH_AUDIENCE=<your api identifier>
AUTH_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://<your Auth0 Domain URL>
```

Example:

```
AUTH_AUDIENCE=http://marketplace/api
AUTH_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://dev-e857rf6yf68r.us.auth0.com/
```

In `<project_dir>/ui/` directory create a `.env` file with _AUTH_AUDIENCE_ and _AUTH_ISSUER_BASE_URL_ taken from Auth0 webside.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN=<your Auth0 Domain URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<your Client ID>
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=<your api identifier>
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost/
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGES_URL=http://localhost:3002/images
```

Example:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGES_URL=http://localhost:3002/images
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN=dev-e857rf6yf68r.us.auth0.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=2352356264366346
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=http://marketplace/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000
```

### Build and run the project

In your main project directory run command below.

```
docker compose up --build -d
```

Open your browser on http://localhost.
